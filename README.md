# sage_print_shop
This homepage was created as an assignment for the Codecademy Frontend development project in the flexbox module. It served as a review of what flexbox is and how to apply it to achieve a homepage layout. I started the project out by brainstorming the type of hoempage I wanted to create. I ended up coming  up with the idea to create a homepage for an imagined printmaking art studio that depicts the type of printmaking specialized there, recent artworks available to view, and the three artists that own and work in the studio. After developing the idea and the structure for the website, I used figma to create a design of the homepage with the color palette, fonts, and images I wanted to incorporate. Once I was happy with the mock up I wrote the html for the homepage and then added the css as the final step. In the beginnig the project seemed a little daunting due to it being very open enededand not really knownig what I wanted to create and how, but once I had the idea and design in motion it wasn't as daunting. Applying the css, especially flexbox, required some experiementing, but in the end I was able to create the homepage as I imagined it in my mock up. Now that I am becoming more confident with the webpage layout, I am interested in learning more about and becoming more confident with turning the website into a responsive one.
